# Not even glue

I remember hearing stuff like: When you grow up and become a real programmer with a real job you'll mostly write glue code. All the stuff is written and you'll just put together the pieces you need.

I remember thinking it sounded sad but I'm not sure if the people who made the claims thought that. Maybe it was a joyful thing or a source of relief.

I haven't found it to be true.

These days I get the impressions that the glue people also don't wanna deal that much with the glue. And so there are frameworks that glue frameworks together for you.

Oh well.

The framework people and the library makers. I'm not convinced they're all souls whose intentions are good.
