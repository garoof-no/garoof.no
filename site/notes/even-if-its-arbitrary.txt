# Even if it's arbitrary
:todo

From The Reflective Practitioner, the architecture example thing. The studio master, Quist, says this at one point:

> You should begin with a discipline, even if it is arbitrary, because the site is so screwy—you can always break it open later.

It's one of those quotes that has stayed with me.

Also there's there's stuff about "back-talk" in the book. Like:

> He shapes the situation, in accordance with his initial appreciation of it, the situation “talks back,” and he responds to the situation’s back-talk.

Reminds me of some stuff.
