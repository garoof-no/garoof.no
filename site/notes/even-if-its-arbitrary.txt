# Even if it's arbitrary
:todo

From The Reflective Practitioner, the architecture example thing. The studio master, Quist, says this at one point:

> You should begin with a discipline, even if it is arbitrary, because the site is so screwy—you can always break it open later.

Also there's stuff like:

> The familiar situation functions as a precedent, or a metaphor, or—in Thomas Kuhn’s phrase—an exemplar for the unfamiliar one.

> Faced with some phenomenon that he finds unique, the inquirer nevertheless draws on some element of his familiar repertoire which he treats as exemplar or as generative metaphor for the new phenomenon.

Blah blah.
