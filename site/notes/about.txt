# No epiphanies

:blurb Mostly eh.

## Me

I'm Jonas.

I sometimes think that my site could have an "about" section. Something like:

> Sir, what if the writer is attempting to create a story where nothing much happens? Where people don't change, they don't have any epiphanies, they struggle and are frustrated and nothing is resolved. More a reflection of the real world.

Blog posts and talks and things can be unlike that but they can also be like that.

I'm not always super comfortable about points being made, or answers being given, or destinations being reached.

I dunno. Like destinations can be cool but things can also get a little "I'm going over here and I'm taking you with me!" and also things can get a little pretend. And the destination might not be more interesting than the starting point. And maybe the starting point is this initial idea that has _all these different paths_ going through it and the way it is a crossroads like that could be the thing as much as one of the possible destinations could be. I dunno.

## POSSN

POSSE is an abbreviation for Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere. POSSN is an abbreviation for Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Nowhere.

Not that there's anything wrong with POSSE, but POSSN really takes the edge of things.

It's possible to like, write a thing and put it on the site and not commit to doing anything more than that with it. Sometimes I give it a day or two and then decide if I wanna post a link to it somewhere else. Or maybe link to it when it seems relevant to some situation. Or just not.

## Blog?

Is blog? Not sure. I sometimes wonder if I should inform people that posts are not final and immutable things that are necessarily mostly written in advance of the publishing timestamp or something like that, or if it's just eh whatever. Probably mostly eh.

## Some contexts

### Functional programming
:id fp

I like programming and I like functions. I guess I like ""FP."" But I don't really like liking FP.

Professionally or career wise or something I kind of grew up in the 2010s. During those years at least, the FP communities tended to be kind of bad. Lots of good stuff, many good people, but it was also just shit.

Like people were doing a fair amount of EWD cosplay. But they went like right for the stupid. Like you know the Dijkstra quotes where Dijkstra's just a fucking idiot?

> The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offense.

> It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.

Like they sure took that kind of stuff to heart, and they sure avoided the ^../notes/single-trick.txt not terribly dogmatic^ bits. They were very proud of not knowing other things. Like I don't understand why Uncle Bob wasn't more _on that._ Could have sold so many bracelets to those fuckers.

And more importantly shitlords like the LambdaConf ones and all the racism.

So I dunno I'm kind of wary of "FP people." But like yeah, woo functions, lambdas. Sums and products are pretty cool. I sometimes enjoy not assigning to a mutable variable. It can be fun to do more programming in the type system I guess.

### Domainy enterprise software engineering
:id enterprise-software-engineering

My work stuff is typically pretty enterprisey, dealing with what I think is called domainy domains: Not incredibly complex or intensive computationally speaking, but things are pretty business rules. Bunch of rules and regulations and things that do not always appear to be consistent, and then those are surrounded by various interpretations and perspectives and opinions that can also be misaligned. Different minds are made up and changed at different times. Stuff.

When people introduce DDD they often talk about certain kinds of software development misunderstandings and ways of talking past each other and stuff, and I'm like yeah that happens all the time. I spend a lot of time in contexts where many of the things DDD attempts to address are real things and a lot of the blue book DDD stuff has been valuable to me.
