# Webby Lua
:todo under construction

Lua is fun. And while I like that it's not part of very complicated web browser tech or something, it _is_ kind of nice to be able to run it the browser. I like using it for example code in posts, and I like having runnable examples. Stuff like that.

The Lua implementation is C code that compiles pretty easily and you can Emscipten-compile it to wasm. I don't _really_ know my way around that kind of stuff, but I found ^https://github.com/Dreagonmon/wasm_lua this wasm_lua on GitHub^, and that had dealt with the stuff I didn't know how to do.

I've made my own version. I've modified some stuff and I've made the GitHub stuff build and deploy it to GitHub pages.
