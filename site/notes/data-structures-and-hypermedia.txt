# One emotiotechnical similarity between hypermedia and purely functional data structures
:todo

I dunno on one level it's like, hypermedia server goes:

* Server receives a request
* Server does the stuf
* Server responds with some complete hypermedia representation of relevant state

And with a purely functional ""object"" it sometimes goes like:

* Method call is received
* The object calculates the stuf
* The object returns a new complete object

So viewed from client/caller side, there's the previous thing and the new thing and no in-between thing. No object with two out of three instance variables updated. The returned object is returned in its initial and final state, as constructed. Gnerally speaking, stuff can fail, but the new object would fail to exist rather than fail to update some of its state.

Similarly, no "mostly the new hypermedia document but with some of the old that failed to update." While getting half a document back might be more of a thing, because network calls and how web browser tends to work and so on, it'd still be more of a incomplete document thing. And not an "it updated the content in 2 out of 3 `p` tags" thing.

I don't think good design falls out of following a specific practice or anything, ^./single-trick.txt there is no trick to it^, etc. But I do think the distinctness of old and new state emphasizes the state transitions in a way that is useful for me.
